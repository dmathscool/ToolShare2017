Work in progress - git commands for the branch/rebase/merge workflow suggested in class

1) git pull origin master //Gets the latest code from master
2) git checkout -b yourbranchname // This branches from master at the latest point
3) git commit //do your work and checkin
4) git push -u origin yourbranchname //You don't need to do this, but it's nice for everyone to see
5) TODO - add the rebase commands here
6) TODO - add the merge commands here

My trick - if I am working on a branch that someone else is using, before I check in I might "stash" and pull the latest changes
git stash //puts your work in progress in a special place
git pull // gets the latest from the public version of the branch you are on
git stash apply //re-do my in progress changes on the latest code


git status - tells you where you are
